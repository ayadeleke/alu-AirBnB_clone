# Airbnb Clone Project

## Command Interpreter for Managing Airbnb Objects

Welcome to the Airbnb Clone project! This is the first step towards building a full web application, the Airbnb clone. In this initial phase, we will develop a command interpreter to manage Airbnb objects. This command interpreter is a crucial component of the project as it will be used throughout the development process, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and more.

## Project Overview

### Key Objectives

- Implement a parent class named `BaseModel` responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing future instances of objects.
- Establish a simple flow for serialization and deserialization, involving instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and files.
- Create classes for essential Airbnb components such as User, State, City, Place, all of which will inherit from the `BaseModel`.
- Develop the first abstracted storage engine for the project, known as File Storage.
- Write unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine.

### What's a Command Interpreter?

Think of the command interpreter as a simplified version of the Shell, tailored to our project's specific needs. In our case, the command interpreter enables us to:

1. **Create New Objects:** You can create new objects, such as a new User or a new Place, through the interpreter.

2. **Retrieve Objects:** Retrieve objects from various sources like files or databases.

3. **Perform Operations on Objects:** You can perform operations on objects, such as counting objects or computing statistics related to them.

4. **Update Object Attributes:** Modify the attributes of an object to keep your data up to date.

5. **Destroy Objects:** Delete objects when they are no longer needed.

## Getting Started

To begin working on the Airbnb Clone project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this project repository to your local machine using the Git command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayadeleke/alu-AirBnB_clon.git

## Getting Started

To begin working on the Airbnb Clone project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this project repository to your local machine using the Git command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-clone.git
2. Set Up Your Development Environment: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You may want to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

3. Explore the Code: Dive into the provided code, which includes the FileStorage class and other related modules. Understand how the serialization, deserialization, and object management processes work.

4. Implement Your Classes: As per the project requirements, create classes for User, State, City, Place, and other Airbnb components. Ensure they inherit from the BaseModel class.

5. Write Unit Tests: Develop unit tests to validate the functionality of your classes and the storage engine. Make sure your objects can be created, retrieved, updated, and destroyed as intended.

6. Extend the Command Interpreter: Enhance the command interpreter to support the required functionalities for managing Airbnb objects.

7. Start Building the Web Application: With the foundation in place, you can now move on to the subsequent project phases, including HTML/CSS templating, database integration, and front-end development.

## How to Use the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter allows you to interact with Airbnb objects using a command-line interface. Here are some example commands you can use:

create: Create a new Airbnb object.
show: Retrieve and display an object's details.
all: List all Airbnb objects.
update: Modify attributes of an object.
destroy: Delete an object.
quit or EOF (Ctrl+D): Exit the interpreter.
For detailed usage instructions, consult the project documentation and user guide.
